INTRODUCTION
========================================
This guide contains crisp instructions to integrate ShieldSquare for Real-time Bot management Solution with your GoLang Web application. You can start the integration in Monitor Mode wherein you can analyse the site traffic and uncover all malicious bot related information. There is no action performed for prevention of the bot activities, rather the website is staged for studying and observing all the bot/genuine hits encountered.
